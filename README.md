# Mobile App Bootstrap: Objective-C preview
[![Community Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Community%20Supported-457387.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

Provides an early look at example code for how to embed Tableau vizzes inside of a native iOS app.

## Prerequisites
This objective-c version of the Mobile App Bootstrap only supports iOS.

## Installation

Hopefully straightforward:

1. Install Xcode
2. Download the code for the app from this [repository](https://github.com/tableau/mobile-app-bootstrap)

## Starting the Tableau Sample App

1. Open `Mobile App Bootstrap.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Choose/click "Run"

This should run the app in a simulator, depending on the scheme set in Xcode. 

In order to run on a physical device, you'll need to adjust the Team signing profile in the Xcode project. From the Xcode project navigator, click the Mobile App Bootstrap project. Within the project info, click the Mobile App Bootstrap target, choose the General tab, and set a Team in the Signing section. This starts to get into app distribution, and Apple has extensive documentation with both a [Quick Start](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Introduction/Introduction.html) and a [more detailed guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html).


# Project Layout

The app is meant to be as simple as possible: a UITabBarController with 4 UIViewControllers, each containing a WKWebView. The UIViewControllers are separated into their own classes in this sample. The Home WebView opens a local web page bundled in the app, while the other 3 WebViews open visualizations hosted on Tableau Public.

Tableau Connected Clients are used, with a modified version of the Connected Clients library. Once this sample app is farther along (see Limitations, below), the modifications to the Connected Clients library will be submitted to its repo.

## Customization Points

`AppDelegate.m`  
Change `https://public.tableau.com` to your internal server.

`Viz1ViewController.m`, `Viz2ViewController.m`, `Viz3ViewController.m`  
Change the viz URLs to point to your own visualizations. Consider including the URL query parameters in the sample URLs, described in more detail in comments in `Viz1ViewController.m`.

`www/index.html`  
Modify to suit.

# Limitations

This code is strictly an early look, and is sadly far from complete.

* Links within WebViews  
Tapping a link in one of these WebViews will follow the link...but there isn't a Back button included with this sample.  

* Connected Clients  
Connected Clients are implemented, via a simple Token Manager. Unfortunately it doesn't yet perform re-authentication. So while it will keep the user signed in between app runs and device reboots, it will timeout based on Tableau Server's setting. On Server, this is configuralbe via its .yml file:  
`wgserver.session.idle_limit: 240`  
That value is in minutes, and affects all clients: Web, Desktop, and Mobile.

* Sign In on Phone  
The Sign In experience on a phone is, charitably: nonoptimal. There's a way to inject some CSS into the WebView to make things lok nicer, via some JavaScript:  
`"var styleNode = document.createElement('style'); styleNode.type = 'text/css'; styleNode.innerHTML = ' .tb-login{min-width:0 !important; width: " + width + "px; } .tb-login-site-picker-container {margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; } '; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(styleNode);"`  
WebView has `EvaluateJavascript` for passing this in. Sadly, the sample code doesn't yet implement this.

* Sign In approach  
In this sample, Sign In happen inside the same viz as the WebView...this might need to be broken out in a separate WebView that only processes Sign In.

# Future Plans

* Address the Limitations above
